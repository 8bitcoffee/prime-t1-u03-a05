# Arrays & Loops Activity

Take turns driving! Each answer must contain a loop (for or while). You will need loops, conditionals, variables, push and pop. Try adding your results to the DOM using `innerHTML`.

The focus of this activity is practice and understanding - this assignment will not be graded. It's OK if you don't finish and all members of your team may turn in the same code for this assignment.
